# Ruuku DotFiles

Dot files from my WSL config, this repo is more for myself. A lot of code has been taken from other sources which I cannot remember.
Still improving them, not completely happy yet.

## Install

It's probably a good idea not to install all of it. Download all the code as a zip then extract (hopefully not in your ~/). Copy and paste parts of it you want into your Config files.
